# A-Quantitative-Momentum-Investing-Strategy

"Momentum investing" means investing in the stocks that have increased in price the most.

The goal of this project is to build an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the highest price momentum. From there, recommended trades can be calculated for an equal-weight portfolio of these 50 stocks.
